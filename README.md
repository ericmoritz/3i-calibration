# Duplicator i3 Calibration

This project is my attempt to improve the quality of my Wanhoa
Duplicator printer.

I get obsessed with optimization and this is the result of that obsession.

# Build Notes

* 2015-10-29T12:27 - make/dimensional_accuracy_test.stl
  * Replaced the DiiCooler with the rear mounted Cobra Cooler because the DiiCooler blocked the view and dropped the extruder temp by 10c when turned on.
  * Extruder Temp appox 190c instead of the request 200c
  * Y=20.05mm, X=20.15mm, avg diff=0.1mm, score=4
* 2015-10-26T01:25 - Test_your_3D_printer_v2_0.48mm.stl
  * Corners lifted with the PLA settings and clean glass bed
  * Extruded Temp was set to 200c but averaged around 180c
