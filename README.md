# Duplicator i3 Calibration

This project is my attempt to improve the quality of my Wanhoa
Duplicator printer.

I get obsessed with optimization and this is the result of that obsession.

I started with a default Cura profile with the Filiment Diameter set
to 1.75mm and the Nozzle size set to 0.4mm.

I started with [3dbenchy](http://www.3dbenchy.com/) print to see what
issues there were.

I had a few issues with this print:

* xxx
* yyy

There are a number of suggestions online to fix these issues but no
systematic proof of what settings improve what.
